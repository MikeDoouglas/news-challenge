# Django Challenge

## Development


### 1. Create Python Virtual Environment

```
$ python3 -m venv env
$ . env/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 2. Environment variables

Duplicate `.env.example`, rename to `.env` and set environment variables.

### 3. Running
Development:
```
$ docker-compose up 
```

### 4. Create super user

Create super user into container:

```
$ docker-compose exec api bash
$ python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### 5. Just use it!

Use [this Postman Collection](postman_collection.json) ([How to import Collections on Postman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting-data/#importing-postman-data))

## Production

Execute all previous steps, only for steps **#3** and **#4** you need to add flag `-f docker-compose.prod.yml` to docker-compose command.

> Note: If you ran **development** Docker Compose file before, you need to rebuild it for production: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml build`

# Jungle Devs - Django Challenge #001

## Description

**Challenge goal**: The purpose of this challenge is to give an overall understanding of a backend application. You’ll be implementing a simplified version of a news provider API. The concepts that you’re going to apply are:

- REST architecture;
- Authentication and permissions;
- Data modeling and migrations;
- PostgreSQL database;
- Query optimization;
- Serialization;
- Production builds (using Docker).

**Target level**: This is an all around challenge that cover both juniors and experience devs based on the depth of how the concepts were applied.

**Final accomplishment**: By the end of this challenge you’ll have a production ready API.

## Acceptance criteria

- Clear instructions on how to run the application in development mode
- Clear instructions on how to run the application in a Docker container for production
- A good API documentation or collection
